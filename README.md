# FriendZone
Mark Zuckerberg started FaceBook as a small application where he could connect with his university friends. And now FaceBook has evolved to a Multi Billion Dollar company.
Social Media Applications are so popular that it is difficult to imagine a day without them. Building a Social Media application according to user's requirements can one day become as famous as FaceBook. This is why I built "FriendZone" which is basically a small scale version of Facebook and implemented some of its basic features. This application will help you to connect with your friends and to share your thoughts with them.

## Features
- This is a fully functional web application built using MERN Stack Technology.
- Users can create new account and Login/Logout to their account.

- You can also view the Profile of other users who are registered in "FriendZone". You can also add them to your FriendList.
